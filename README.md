## About Me
I'm howardthesheep. I've been interested in computers and electronics for as long as I can 
remember. In my early teens I began to learn basic software config & languages such as: html, css, 
visual basic, and javascript. I always liked frontend development the most. It provided that instant
visual feedback of your progress. From there I explored server-side languages to perform tasks that
couldn't be done client side. Which unfortunatley for myself, was PHP... but those trials and tribulations
made me the man I am today.

Midway through High School I picked up Java, my first 'software engineering' language as I call it. 
Then came C during college. Despite being very different in nature from web development, I really enjoyed 
creating programs in these languages. Ever since then I've been learning languages & frameworks as required
for projects.
- Some old: bash, ColdFusion, Perl, SQL, Haskell, Python
- Some new: React, React Native, Golang, HAML, SASS, QT,  Unity Engine, Node.js, Flutter, Dart
- Some in-between: Ruby, C#

At this point, language or framework doesn't matter. If you can conceptualize a logically valid system, I am
certain I can model it in software. At the end of the day, everything is quantifiable data waiting for someone
to do something meaningful with it.
